Okay, I can help with that. Displaying very large images like 40MP can indeed be demanding for the browser if done with a simple `<img>` tag, as it tries to decode and render the entire image at once. Using WebGL or Canvas can allow for more optimized rendering, potentially by rendering only the visible part of the image (tiling) or by using the GPU for faster image processing.

However, implementing a performant WebGL/Canvas image viewer from scratch is a complex task. It involves handling image decoding, zooming, panning, and potentially tiling for very large images.

Before diving into a custom implementation, it's worth considering if there are existing libraries that can help.

I'll start by searching for React libraries that specialize in displaying large images using WebGL or Canvas.

The search results provided a few potentially relevant libraries and articles:

1.  **`react-zoomer`**: This library is specifically designed for zooming and panning large images using a canvas. It seems like a good candidate.
2.  **`react-intense`**: This is a React port of Intense Image Viewer, which is also for viewing large images up close. It uses `requestAnimationFrame` and might employ canvas or other techniques for performance.
3.  **Articles on creating canvas components in React**: These could be useful if we decide to build a custom solution, but let's explore existing libraries first.

Given these options, `react-zoomer` seems the most directly applicable to your request for a canvas-based solution. `react-intense` is also worth investigating.

I'll start by looking at `react-zoomer`'s documentation and see how it might integrate into your existing `ProgressiveImage` component. If it's not suitable, I'll then look into `react-intense`.

Would you like me to proceed with investigating `react-zoomer` first? Or do you have a preference for which library to explore or a different approach in mind?
