# 新增触发 Cloudflare Pages 部署钩子 (2025-06-05 14:02:18)

_**User**_

这里新增触发 cf 的 pages deploy hook 

curl -d "" "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/pages/webhooks/deploy_hooks/0c400018-b50f-4e05-a1a7-c474dd32"

_**Assistant**_

I'll add a step to trigger the Cloudflare Pages deploy hook in the GitHub workflow. Looking at the existing workflow, I'll add it as an additional step after the Vercel deployment.

I've successfully added the Cloudflare Pages deploy hook to the GitHub workflow. The changes include:

1. **New step**: Added "Trigger Cloudflare Pages Deploy Hook" step that uses the exact curl command you provided
2. **Updated status**: Modified the deployment status message to indicate that both Vercel and Cloudflare Pages hooks have been triggered

The workflow will now trigger both Vercel and Cloudflare Pages deployments when changes are detected in the `thumbnails/` directory or `photos-manifest.json` file.
