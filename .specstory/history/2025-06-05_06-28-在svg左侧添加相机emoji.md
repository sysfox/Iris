I'll help you add a camera emoji to the left side of the SVG. Looking at your code, I can see you're working on the `svgContent` variable around line 335. Let me add a camera emoji to the left side of the SVG.

Perfect! I've added a camera emoji (📷) to the left side of your SVG. The emoji is positioned at coordinates (30, 100) with a font size of 48px, which should make it clearly visible on the left side of the image while not interfering with your title and description text.

The camera emoji will appear in the upper left area of the generated OG image, giving it a nice photographic touch that matches the theme of your photo gallery.
